# Tick-Tack

### Description
Tick-Tack is a poorly named tic-tac-toe variant. The game is very simple. There are two players, which are x and o. They must compete with each other trying to align either 3 x's or o's, all while trying to stop the other from achieving the same goal. There are 4 outcomes to tick-tack. Either x or o win, or they tie, or the game is unfinished and discarded.

### Planning & Story
I will admit that my planning for this project was not good. In the beginning of the project, my development pace was 0. Towards the end of this project is when I picked up the pace. This was due to personal issues, but I admit that I handled the entire situation poorly.

I started off creating the project with a strong UI foundation, rather than getting all the features and doing UI afterwards. I find that it is easier for me to develop when I already have a foundation, as well as it gives me peace, comfort, and reduces stress. I am a perfectionist, I am very picky especially when it comes to UI, which is why getting it done early is a big thing for me.

I have been developing for a few years. My problem solving strategy has been relatively the same. If I run into a bug I go and look at the error message. If it is something I am spending too much time on, I go ahead and google and get help that way.

### Unsolved Problems & Future Features
Had I given myself more time, I would have created a page designated to view all of the games you've played. I would have it render a new board for each game you played, as well as game statistics such as who the winner is, or whether it's a tie or an unfinished game. I obviously didn't get to this due to me starting so late.

I would have a few more features to add, but I simply cannot think of any at the time of writing this. There are many ways to improve this project, and a lot of features I could add, despite the API limitations and lack of data.
